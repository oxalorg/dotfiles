;; This is your user signals file, here you configure how certain signals are
;; handled in specific modes.

;; In this Corgi sample config we've included `js-comint' to demonstrate how
;; that works. This package allows evaluating JavaScript directly from a buffer.
;; Evaluating the expression before the cursor is done in Corgi with `, RET' (or
;; `, e e'), by telling Corgi that in JS buffers this means `js-send-last-sexp'
;; we get the same bindings there.
;;
;; If you prefer some other key binding for "eval", then you can do that in
;; `user-keys.el', and your new binding will do the right thing regardless of
;; the language/mode you are in.
